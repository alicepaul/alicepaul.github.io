							<h2>About Me.<br /></h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostats/home">Biostatistics at Brown University</a>
							interested in algorithms, optimization, data science, and education. My research 
							has focused on the design and analysis of optimization algorithms underlying 
							machine learning with recent applications to clustering, variable selection,
							 risk models, and bike-share or other shared mobility systems. I also enjoy 
							 thinking about predictive analytics: how data informs our future decisions. 
					   </p>
					   <p>
						   Prior to joining Brown, I was an Assistant Professor of Applied Math and Computer Science at Olin 
						   College of Engineering. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Data Science 
						   Initiative at Brown University, advised by Professor Pedro Felzenszwalb. I completed my PhD in the 
						   Department of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University, advised by 
						   Professor David Williamson, and I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Harvey Mudd 
						   College, where my undergraduate thesis adviser was Professor Susan Martonosi.
					   </p>

						<b>Research Opportunities: </b> I am currently looking for students with a background in optimization,
						operations resarch, or prescriptive analytics for Summer 2025! The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) 
						is the primary transit service within Rhode Island. The planning, scheduling, and data analysis teams within RIPTA
						 use past ridership data to drive future operational decisions. This project will use this data to help support 
						 RIPTA's mission of providing reliable and cost-effective service across the community by developing a data-driven 
						 way to maximize service under resource constraints. A key objective will also be to make this decision-making tool 
						 transparent and explainable to the public. This work is supported by a 
						 <a href="https://dsi.brown.edu/research/dsi-funded-research/data-science-grants-brown-2024">DSI Seed Grant</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
						If you are a current student at Brown and are interested in 
						thesis or research opportunities, please email with a CV and your coursework in 
						statistics, applied math, and computer science.
