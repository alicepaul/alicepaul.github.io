I am an Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Olin College of Engineering interested in algorithms, optimization, and data science. My research primarily focuses on the design and analysis of optimization algorithms underlying bike-share systems, machine learning, revenue management, and other applications. I also enjoy thinking about how data informs these algorithms. 

Prior to joining Olin, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Data Science Initiative at Brown University under the advisement of [Professor Pedro Felzenszwalb](http://cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/). I completed my PhD in the Department of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University, advised by [Professor David Williamson](http://davidpwilliamson.net/work/), and I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Harvey Mudd College, where my undergraduate thesis adviser was [Professor Susan Martonosi](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/susan-martonosi/).

If you are a student interested in research, please email me. 

My CV can be found [here](/files/apaul_cv.pdf).
