I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Brown University interested in algorithms, optimization, data science, and education. My research has focused on the design and analysis of optimization algorithms underlying bike-share systems, machine learning, revenue management, and other applications. I also enjoy thinking about how data informs these algorithms. Recent research projects with students have involved using data science to analyze the use of bike-share and scooter-share programs.  

Prior to joining Brown, I was an Assistant Professor of Applied Math and Computer Science at Olin College of Engineering. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Data Science Initiative at Brown University under the advisement of [Professor Pedro Felzenszwalb](http://cs.brown.edu/people/pfelzens/). I completed my PhD in the Department of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University, advised by [Professor David Williamson](http://davidpwilliamson.net/work/), and I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Harvey Mudd College, where my undergraduate thesis adviser was [Professor Susan Martonosi](https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/susan-martonosi/).

If you are a student interested in research, please email me.
