				<p>
					My courses give students the tools to build upon the skills developed in the course through 
					building intuition about how methods are used and expanded upon in practice, homework assignments 
					that reflect the open-ended nature of data analysis, and shareable course projects that help
					students career development. Courses highlighted below have further details.

					<h2>PHP 1560/2560: Statistical Programming in R</h2> <p>
						Statistical computing is an essential part of data analysis. This courses practices approaching problems by thinking through the logic and translating that logic into 
						code with a focus on using these skills in statistical applications. We focus on understanding the key libraries
						in R, learning how to structure code in building blocks, and developing good coding
						practices. Students also learn to read and evaluate other's code.

					<b> Course Format: </b>
						This course is taught in a flipped format. Students read a notebook prior to class explaining
						the key concepts that week and answering a few short questions to test their understanding. 
						The weekly lab then consists of group exercises for which solutions are explained and shared 
						after students have had a chance to attempt them on their own. Additionally, there are 1-2 problems 
						that are for out-of-class.

					<p>
					<b>Final Project:</b>
						In the final project, students build website using the shiny package in RStudio that features a simulation or optimization application.
						 Projects are graded on appropriate use of the course tools seen so far as well as the structure and documentation of their code.

					<h2>PHP 2550: Practical Data Analysis</h2> <p>
						Analyzing data is a core skill for many scientists. In addition to familiarity with probability 
						and statistics, good data analysis requires skill in computing and effective presentation of 
						results and communication with scientific colleagues. This course thinks about how to translate
						 the scientific question and hypothesis into a testable form, advise about data to be collected, 
						 and manipulate the data into a computable format to carry out appropriate analysis.</p>
					<p>
						This course is designed for graduate students who will be analyzing data with scientific colleagues 
						and who want to develop a practical hands-on toolkit and gain experience in distilling complex statistical 
						information into formats understandable to colleagues. Topics including data collection, exploratory data analysis,
						 missing data, fitting and checking models, simulation, predictive models, and presentation of reproducible 
						 results are developed through a series of case studies.

					<p>
					<b> Course Format: </b>
						This course is partially flipped and includes both lecture and group discussion. Students are expected
						to complete readings in advance of class period to complete group discussions and exercises, see the example below.
						Homework assignments each contain one paper response and one open-ended data analysis prompt related
						to each module of the course.

					<b>Final Project (Fall 2022):</b>
						The final project was a semester-long project in collaboration with Dr. Ernest Julian, the Co-Chair
						 of Healthy People 2030 Foodborne Illness Reduction Committee and a former Assistant Director 
						 of Health at the Rhode Island Department of Health. Students were tasked with using the NCBI's 
						 Foodborne Pathogen database to drive action. While students each choose
						 their own approach, the general goal is that we are looking to extract patterns about 
						 cases over time by looking at the genetic and source information available. Students
						 were responsible for providing a literature review, exploratory analysis report, and 
						 analysis plan to get feedback along the way with the final deliverables being a poster (presented at
						 an open poster session) and report with corresponding github repository.

					<h2>PHP 2650: Statistical Learning and Big Data</h2> <p>
						This course introduces modern statistical learning tools with a focus on tools developed for big data. 
						It covers three interconnected components: statistical machine learning methods, 
						the underlying algorithms, and computational tools. This course focuses on the principal 
						techniques to analyze data from start to finish: managing large data, exploring patterns, 
						framing statistical problems, building efficient computational algorithms, and writing reports. 
						Topics include data management, feature engineering, clustering, convex optimization algorithms, 
						tree/ensemble methods, and neural networks.

					<b> Course Format: </b>
						This course is lecture-based with computational labs during class time. Lectures focus on 
						the theoretical underpinnings of the methods while the labs highlight the application while
						also emphasizing some of the key points of the lecture. Students can work in groups
						through the lab material. Homework assignments contain a mixture of 2-3 theory questions and 
						one open-ended data analysis prompt.

					<b>Final Project (Spring 2022):</b>
					The final project was a group project to learn about a topic not seen in class. 
					Students could choose a direct extension of a topic seen, give an introduction to a new topic,
					 or do a survey topic talking about a broader theme. Given the changing landscape of statistical 
					 learning, the goal of this project was to practice reading about a new topic and explaining it 
					 to others along with a short application through a blog post. This also gave students a chance 
					 to create something that highlighted what they were are most interested in. Students were graded on
					 their understanding and explanation of the topic along with creating an engaging presentation.
